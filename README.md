### <h1> Hi, My name is Justin Monge!ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2> Self-taught Back-End Developer work-in-progress</h2>

<p> I am currently learning the fundamentals of Python, SQL, Databases, Version Control (Git), Machine Learning and Data Science through Zero to Mastery's online Complete Python Developer program. I have already applied the knowledge I've gained to build several projects that showcase my skills in Python programming</p>

<p> Having spent the last 15+ years as a military member in the Canadian Armed Forces, I have developed strong communication skills, problem-solving, time management and leadership skills that I hope to apply the exciting challenges in Back-End development.</p>

<ul>&#8226; &#127757; I'm currently based in Oromocto, NB</ul>
<ul>&#8226; &#128187; My projects can be found in "My Portfolio" </ul>
