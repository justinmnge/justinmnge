### <h1> Hi, My name is Justin Monge!ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2> Software Developer </h2>

<p> After completing several Python Developer courses, to include Zero to Mastery's Complete Python Developer program, I have continued to further my knowledge in Python programming through a variety of side projects that also demonstrate my proficiency in Version Control and Linux.</p>

<p>With over 15 years of dedicated service as a military member in the Canadian Armed Forces, I have honed invaluable skills in communication, leadership, problem-solving, and time management. I am eager to leverage these competencies in tackling the dynamic challenges inherent to Software Development.</p>
